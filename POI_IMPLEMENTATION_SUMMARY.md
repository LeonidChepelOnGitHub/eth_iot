# POI Consensus Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented all requested enhancements to the POI (Proof of Identity) consensus protocol in go-ethereum. The POI protocol now includes signer health monitoring, performance-based selection, and a no-turn backup process.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Signer Health Parameter
- Added `SignerHealth` enum with `Healthy` and `Unhealthy` states
- Integrated health tracking into the `Snapshot` structure
- Methods added:
  - `MarkHealthy()` - marks a signer as healthy
  - `MarkUnhealthy()` - marks a signer as unhealthy
  - `IsHealthy()` - checks if a signer is healthy

### 2. Signer Performance Parameter
- Added performance tracking as `int64` value (representing compute power)
- Performance must be >= 0
- Methods added:
  - `SetPerformance()` - sets performance for a signer
  - `GetPerformance()` - retrieves performance for a signer
- RPC endpoint: `poi_setSignerPerformance(address, performance)`

### 3. Sorted Signer Pool
- Implemented `GetActiveSigners()` method that:
  - Filters only healthy signers
  - Sorts by performance (descending) then by signer ID (ascending)
  - Returns ordered list of active signers
- Modified `inturn()` method to use active signers instead of all signers

### 4. No-turn Backup Process
- Added `GetBackupSigner()` method for backup node selection
- Implemented health monitoring in `monitorBlock()` method
- Automatic failure tracking:
  - Records failures when expected signer misses block
  - Marks signer unhealthy after threshold failures
  - Resets failure count on successful block production

### 5. Configuration Parameters
Added to `PoiConfig`:
```go
BackupTimeout   uint64 // Timeout in seconds before backup activation (default: 30)
HealthThreshold int    // Number of failures before marking unhealthy (default: 3)
RecoveryPeriod  uint64 // Time in seconds before node can be healthy again (default: 300)
```

## Modified Files

1. **consensus/poi/snapshot.go**
   - Added health and performance tracking
   - Implemented sorted signer pool logic
   - Added backup signer selection

2. **consensus/poi/poi.go**
   - Added failure tracking mechanism
   - Integrated health monitoring
   - Added error for invalid performance

3. **consensus/poi/api.go**
   - Added `SetSignerPerformance` RPC method

4. **internal/web3ext/web3ext.go**
   - Added JavaScript binding for `setSignerPerformance`

5. **params/config.go**
   - Extended `PoiConfig` with new parameters
   - Set default values for new parameters

6. **consensus/poi/poi_health_test.go** (new)
   - Unit tests for health management
   - Unit tests for performance tracking
   - Unit tests for sorted signer pool
   - Unit tests for backup signer selection

## How It Works

1. **Health Monitoring**: The system tracks block production failures. When a signer fails to produce a block when it's their turn, a failure is recorded. After reaching the `HealthThreshold`, the signer is marked unhealthy.

2. **Performance-Based Selection**: Signers are sorted by their performance metric (higher is better). When multiple signers have the same performance, they're sorted by address to ensure deterministic ordering.

3. **Backup Process**: When the in-turn signer fails to produce a block within the timeout period, the next healthy signer from the sorted pool is selected. This prevents network stalls while maintaining fork prevention.

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Set signer performance via RPC
web3.poi.setSignerPerformance("0x123...", 100);

// Get current snapshot to see health and performance
const snapshot = await web3.poi.getSnapshot();
console.log(snapshot.health);      // Health status of signers
console.log(snapshot.performance);  // Performance metrics
```

## Testing

Run the new tests with:
```bash
go test ./consensus/poi -run TestSigner
```

## Next Steps

1. Integration testing with multiple nodes
2. Performance benchmarking
3. Recovery mechanism implementation (optional)
4. Monitoring dashboard for signer health/performance
